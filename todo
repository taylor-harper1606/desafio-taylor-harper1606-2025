# 1 
Design the code with a single method using ifs and fors, going through each logical step in order. That way we guarantee to have a working code.

- Have the list DONE
- Validate input DONE
- End code with error if input invalid DONE
- Check person1 through animals, removing toys if necessary
- Check person2
- If animal conflict, remove animal (tadinho) and go through loop again
- Export result

# 2
Optimize the code using properties, such as "hoarder" (for the cats) and "friend" (for Loco).

# 3
Learn how to use prototypes and try to apply it in the code.
